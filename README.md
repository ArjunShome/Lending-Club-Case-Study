# Lending Club Case Study

## Goals of data analysis:  

``` 
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- This project shows the analysis for a lending club with the borrowers and their stats and a possible determination of loan risk factors.
- You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
  When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
  If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.


## Steps Followed
- Step 1: Data Cleaning 1
- Step 2: Univariate Analysis
- Step 3: Segemented Univariate Analysis
- Step 4: Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis
- Step 5: Results


## Technologies Used
- MatplotLib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas


## Conclusions
- Lending Club should reduce higher interest loans for 60 months tenure, which are prone to loan default
- Lending club should consider checking the grades of the borrowers before lending them loans, preferably to Grade 'A' customers, who has the best record to fully repay the loans
- Loans for the purpose of starting a small business should be reduced by lending club as they will tend to default more.
- Lending club should check the work experience of the customers and try to provide loans to the borrowers who has more than a year of work experience at least.
- Lending club should prefer giving loans to borrowers having higher Annual income at least above 60000
